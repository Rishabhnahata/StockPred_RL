**Stock Price Prediction:** 

Equity, sometimes referred to as stock, is a financial instrument that symbolises the ownership of a portion of a company. This gives the stockholder the right to a share of the company's assets and earnings in proportion to their ownership stake. Stock is divided into units known as "shares." The ownership certificates of any corporation are generally referred to as stocks. Market forces cause stock values to fluctuate daily. This refers to the fact that supply and demand affect share prices. The price of a stock rises when demand (buyers) outweighs supply (sellers). On the other hand, if more individuals wanted to sell a stock than acquire it, the price would drop since there would be more supply than demand. Supply and demand is simple to understand. Why do stock prices fluctuate, then? The best response is that there is no absolute solution. There are those who claim that it is impossible to forecast the price of stocks, while others think that you can figure out when to purchase and sell by creating charts and examining historical price movements. We can say with certainty only that stocks are erratic and subject to sharp price swings.

**Understanding Problem Statement:**

We'll shortly begin the project's implementation phase, but first it's critical to identify the problem we hope to tackle. The two main categories of stock market analysis are technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Analysing a company's future profitability by examining its financial performance and current business environment is known as fundamental analysis. On the other hand, technical analysis involves analysing charts and utilising statistical data to determine market patterns. We will concentrate on the technical analysis and visualisation portion, as you might expect.

**Reinforcement Learning:**

Under the machine learning technique known as reinforcement learning (RL), an agent gains decision-making skills by interacting with its surroundings in a way that maximises cumulative rewards. In reinforcement learning (RL), as opposed to supervised learning, the agent experiments with various actions, gets feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and modifies its approach by trial and error. It adheres to the framework of the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which consists of states, actions, incentives, and policies. In fields where making decisions in dynamic contexts is essential, such robotics, gaming (like AlphaGo), and self-driving cars, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques like Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are extensively utilised.

**Long Short-Term Memory Algorithm:**

One kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was created to manage sequential input and get around the vanishing gradient issue that conventional RNNs have. It accomplishes this by employing specialised memory cells and gating mechanisms, which include input, forget, and output gates, to control the information flow and preserve significant historical data over extended periods of time. Because of this, LSTMs are very good at time-series prediction, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP) applications. They are extensively employed in fields where identifying long-term connections in data is essential, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and language modelling.

**TD(0) Algorithm:**

A basic reinforcement learning technique, the TD(0) (Temporal Difference) algorithm estimates value functions without the need for an environment model by fusing elements of dynamic programming and Monte Carlo. The difference between the reward and the current estimate, plus the estimated value of the subsequent state (bootstrapping), is used to update the value of a state.
